Version 1.1

-Changed from using numpy.median() to using numpy.nanmedian() in order to remove unwanted increase in intensity as the radius approaches the edges of the image.
-Changed from calculating the median column by column through a for loop to using native numpy functions over the whole image, resulting in MedianPy being called once instead of 1600 times.
